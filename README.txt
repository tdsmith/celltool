Overview
--------
CellTool is a suite of command-line tools for analyzing shapes from images, 
as well as a set of modules for the Python language which both provide this
functionality and can be used by other Python tools for scientific image and
shape analysis.

CellTool was developed and is maintained by Zachary Pincus as a part of his
PhD dissertation for Biomedical Informatics at Stanford. This software is
provided under the GPL license (see LICENSE.txt for more details); please 
contact Zachary if an alternative licensing arrangement is required.


Installation
------------
This software should work on Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows; only the first two
have been well-tested however. Linux and Windows users, as well as advanced
Mac users who have installed their own version of Python, will need to install
CellTool from the source files, which requires a C/C++ and Fortran compiler.
See the file INSTALL.txt for more details. 

Double-clickable installer packages for both CellTool and numpy (a numerical
computation package for Python on which CellTool depends) are provided for Mac 
OS X 10.3.9 and later.


Usage
-----
Please see the CellTool example and tutorial files for more details.
