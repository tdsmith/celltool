This is a subset of Sean Mauch's "Sean's Template Library", which can be obtained in full from:
http://www.its.caltech.edu/~sean/projects.html

The full library includes much functionality for computational geometry; herein is the subset required for the "Closest Point Transform", which produces signed distance maps from 2D polygons or 3D triangle meshes.
